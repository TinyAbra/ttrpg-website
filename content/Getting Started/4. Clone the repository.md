In order for Git to properly track your changes, you will need a copy of the repository on your computer. This is where you will create/update your obsidian vaults for them to be reflected to the site. Making this copy on your local computer is referred to as "Cloning the repository."

While there are fancy ways to do this using Git commands, the simplest way is to download the zip from Github and unzip it to your desired storage location.

Download the zip from [[https://github.com/TinyAbra/ttrpg-website/archive/refs/heads/v4.zip|here]].

Extract the folder to your desired storage location -  once done, the resulting top-level folder should be named ttrpg-website-4.

Now that the repository has been cloned, we can now setup [[5. Install Obsidian|Obsidian]]
