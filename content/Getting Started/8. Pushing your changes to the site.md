When this article talks about "pushing your changes", it means to publish your changes to the main repository which will then cause the site to be automatically rebuilt and published.

First it will be helpful to define a few terms that is used by Git to better understand the process.
- Changes - These are the files that have been altered from their original state. This include text changes, file renames, file creations, and even file deletions.
- Staged Changes - Changes that the user has specified are ready to be published. This is useful for delineating between changes that are ready to be published, and changes that aren't, to keep those that aren't from being published too early.
- Branch - The current active instance of the repository that you are making changes to. Think of it as the clone of the entire repository that you are editing locally.
- Commit - A commit is a packaged set of changes across many files that have been prepared to be pushed to the remote repository.
- Push - A push is the action that publishes all of your commits to the active working branch in the remote repository
- Pull - A pull will call the remote repository and have it update your local clone to match the remote one. This will update your local copy of the repository and vaults to be the same as what is currently on the site. It is recommended to pull the repository before starting any new changes.

Now with the technicalities out of the way. The following steps will explain how to actually publish the changes.

1. Stage the changes that you would like to publish. Changes are staged by clicking the '+' button either next to a specific file that you want to stage, or next to the "Changes" header to stage all of your changes. Additionally there is a "Stage all" button on the top toolbar.

> [!NOTE] Un-staging Changes
> Sometimes you accidentally stage a change that you don't actually want published. To un-stage changes, the '-' button can be used in all of the same ways as the stage changes button. 

2. Commit your changes. Creating a commit, is like telling Git to take all of your currently staged changes and package them up so that they are ready to be published to the remote repository. A commit will require a commit message that will give a short explanation of what the changes included in this commit are - keep it short, a few words if possible. Then you can click the "Commit-and-sync" button in the toolbar to make your commit. In the example below, the commit message is "updated instructions". When you make your commit, your changes, will disappear from your source control panel - this is expected.

> [!NOTE] Multiple commits
> The general idea behind commits is that similar changes are bundled together into a single commit. This means that it is recommended that the user group their changes into different commits based on the content of the changes. You can make as many commits as you need to.

3. Pushing your commits. Once your changes are packaged into commits, they are ready to be pushed to the main repository. This is done using the "Push" button from the toolbar. This will push all of the commits that you have made locally.

> [!NOTE] Pulling changes
> As mentioned above, it is recommended to pull the repository before making changes locally, and its generally just a good idea to do them periodically. To initiate a pull, click the "Pull" button, next to the "Push" button. 

4. Check your changes on the site! Once the commits are pushed, the remote repository will automatically start a build job to publish your changes to the site - this will generally take a minute or so, but then you should be able to refresh the site and see your changes live.

That's it! You've made your first changes to the site. Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
Good luck Lorekeeper and may your journey be successful
