The entire site has been setup so that the addition of the "graph-exclude" tag on a page will stop it from appearing on the dot map. 

This is useful for pages that are not integral to the wider wiki connection, or if you'd just like it hidden from view. As an example, the graph-exclude tag is used on this page and therefore it will not appear on the dot map.
