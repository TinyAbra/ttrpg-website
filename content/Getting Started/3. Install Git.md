Git is a repository management software that allows for the concurrent editing and manipulation of information by many users at once. In this case, git is what takes all of the changes that are made locally and merges them into the main site information. It will need to be installed on your computer in order for obsidian to hook into the main repository when pushing changes.

First download the Git installer for your operating system [[https://git-scm.com/downloads|here]]. Then proceed with the installation steps below, the installer will likely ask a lot of questions but most of them we can ignore.
1. Launch the installer
2. Review the GNU General Public License and click Next

7. Select a text editor you want to use with Git. This is really only important if you plan to use git in the future for other things... in which case you probably understand what this is asking about. Otherwise, I would recommend selecting "Use Notepad as Git's default editor".

8. The next step allows you to choose a different name for your initial branch. The default is "Let Git decide" and will set default branch names to master. ~This is a problematic term still in use by a lot of legacy applications, again you can just leave this as-is if you don't plan on using Git for anything else, or you can manually enter a default branch name. "main" is the new standard for this.

9. The next step allows you to change the PATH environment. The PATH is the default set of directories included when you run a command from the command line. Keep the middle (recommended) selection and click Next.

10. The installer prompts you to select the SSH client for Git to use. Git already comes with its own SSH client, so if you don't need a specific one... or don't know what an SSH client is, leave the default option and click Next.

11. The next option relates to server certificates. The default option is recommended for most users, click Next.

13. Choose the terminal editor you want to use. The default MinTTY is recommended, click Next to continue.

	![[Pasted image 20241002212606.png]]
14. The next step allows you to choose what the git pull command will do. The default option is recommended unless you specifically need to change its behavior. Click Next to continue.

	![[Pasted image 20241002212651.png]]
15. The next step is to choose which credential helper to use. Git uses credential helpers to fetch or save credentials. The default option is the most stable one. Click Next.

16. The next step lets you decide which extra options to enable, keep file system caching checked and click Next.

17. Depending on which version of Git you are installing, it may offer to install experimental features, you can ignore these. Finally, click Install

	![[Pasted image 20241002212914.png]]
18. Once the installation is complete, tick the boxes to view the Release Notes or launch Git Bash. You do not need to do either of these for our purposes, click Finish.
