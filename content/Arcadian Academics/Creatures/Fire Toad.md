### Appearance:
Small, scaled lizards that resemble frogs in shape and size, but are not amphibious in nature. They have rectangular pupils that appear to have no change when exposed to darkness or bright lights. The toad's toes are devoid of scales to allow a van-der Waals style of wall climbing. Their scales may vary in colour, but consistent themes of browns, oranges and reds appear to be localized. Scales along the top of the head jut out at horn-like angles - this appears to serve no biological function as the sharper scales are neither connected to the inner ear nor particularly useful against predators. Scales on the toad's belly are loose and make crunching sounds when pushed together. This aids in the toad's mating call. 

### Habitat:
Fire Toads make their home in swamps and lush undergrowth. Despite the name, Fire Toads enjoy damp environments and proximity to still water. 

### Behaviour:
Fire Toads typically enjoy feasts of flying insects such as moths and beetles. They are known to consume [[Will'O'Wisps]] with great frequency and joy, however it is unclear how much nutritional value these spirits provide them. A Fire Toad consuming a wisp may resemble a dragon breathing fire, providing the basis of their name and the common misconception that they are a subspecies of wyvern. Fire Toads are generally Crepuscular, when their prey is most active, however Fire Toads in captivity adapt to the feeding habits of their handlers. 
Fire Toads are prey to small predators such as mustelids, young canines, and wyverns. 
##### Purpose: 
Fire Toads are an excellent natural pest control; they consume bugs that can damage plants and small numbers will not damage ecosystems.
